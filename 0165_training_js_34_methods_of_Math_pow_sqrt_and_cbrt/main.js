/*
Coding in function cutCube. function accept 2 parameter: volume and n. volume is the volume of a cube. If we cut the cube into n block. please determine whether the length of the cube is an integer. return true or false.

For exmaple:

volume=27, it can be divided into 27 blocks, each small cube side length is 1

cutCube(27,27) should return true
volume=512, it can be divided into 8 blocks, each small cube side length is 4

cutCube(512,8) should return true
volume=512, it can be divided into 64 blocks, each small cube side length is 2

cutCube(512,64) should return true
If the side length of small cube is not a integer, should return false.

cutCube(256,8) should return false
cutCube(27,3) should return false
cutCube(123,456) should return false
If it can't be divided evenly into n small cubes, should return false too.

cutCube(50000,50) should return false
cutCube(256,4) should return false
The two examples above seems to meet our requirements, but please note: a cube is unable to evenly divided into 50 pieces or 4 pieces. Only cubic numbers(such as 8,27,64,125,216...) can be used to divide the cube evenly.

function cutCube(volume,n){
 if (volume <= 0 || n <= 0) return false;
 if (volume % n !== 0) return false;
 const isPerfectCube = x => Number.isInteger(Math.cbrt(x));
 return isPerfectCube(volume) && isPerfectCube(n);
}
