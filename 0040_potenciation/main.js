/*
Your task is to implement a function that takes two inputs, x and y, and returns the value of x raised to the power of y.

Simple, right? But you are NOT allowed to use Math.pow();

Both x and y will be natural numbers (non-negative integers) in range 0 <= x,y <= 13.

Special Case: For this challenge, 0^0 is defined to be 1.
*/

function power(x,y){
  if (y === 0) return 1;
  let result = 1;
  for (let i = 0; i < y; i++) {
    result *= x;
  }
  return result;
}
